Observing file format
=====================

Each observation is fully defined by its Observing File. This file is in yaml format (human readable, easy to edit).

Here is the standard format for the Observing File (very temporary - to be completed):

.. literalinclude:: ObsFileFormat.yaml
   :language: yaml

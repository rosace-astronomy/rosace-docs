Get started
===========

(this part is to be developed when the project will have enough maturity).

We propose here a step by step path to satrt with ROSACE.

We suggest to start by installing the module 2 (scheduler) and module 3 (observing sequencer). You'll use these modules in
Simulators mode - no real instrument is needed. 

(installation will be described)

Then, edit the configuration file, and check that the modules 2 and 3 have the right parameters.

Use your favorite web browser, and point it to module 3. You can start the observations. 

... to be completed.

Once the Simulators mode is OK, you can switch to the real instrument. To do this, you must give the address of
the INDI server of your observatory. 

... check that you can control the science camera, then the telescope, and all the connected devices.

The five modules
================

The project is made of 5 independant modules:

* Module 1: :ref:`The dome/shelter control <Module1-label>`

Blabla

* Module 2: :ref:`Shelduler (what is the next target to observe) <Module2-label>`
* Module 3: :ref:`Sequencer (run the actual observation) <Module3-label>`
* Module 4: :ref:`Data reduction (to get a scientific result) <Module4-label>`
* Module 5: :ref:`Display and share the results <Module5-label>`

Indepedant modules means that each one can be used independantly from the others. You can even use only some of them, and not all. Of course, the modules must
exchange some data, and this is done through Rest API.

Module 2: Scheduler
===================

The module is part of the :ref:`ROSACE project <MainPage>`

Getting an observatory that is able to work automatically is good. But then, as soon as it is operationnal, the key question is: 
'what is my next target'. 

This is the mission of the Module 2 to reply this question, and define at any time what is the next target to observe.

The strategy can be very simple - for example, you can set a list of targets in a text file.

But is can be also very rich if you have many observatories working together, managing multiple scientific programs. In such cases, 
the question of the next target can be tricky. This module will adapt to any cases - strating by the simple one, of course.

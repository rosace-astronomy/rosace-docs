Welcome to the ROSACE project
=============================

ROSACE is the acronym for **Robotic Observations and Spectrocopic Astronomy, a Collaborative Experience**

This project aims to develop a network of amateur and professional observatories to run Robotic Spectroscopic astronomical observations.
All together, we can offer a new tool to the Science to better understand our Universe.

This project is based on software Open Source tools only.

Robotic observation means that **no human action** is required. From opening the dome (or shelter) to processing the data and sharing the result, 
all is automated. 

The project is developed by the community: any contribution from you is welcome.
Our intention is to propose a system that can be adapted from smallest to biggest telescopes.

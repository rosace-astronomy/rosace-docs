How to Contribute
=================

Welcome to the :ref:`ROSACE project <MainPage>`.

The project is developed by the community, and we need you!

Here are the ways to help developing this tool:

* Install your own observatory and give us any user feedback
* If you're a developper, contact us and tell you where you can help (there is so much to do!)
* Write and/or translate the documentation (the plan is to get only an english version, but we never know)

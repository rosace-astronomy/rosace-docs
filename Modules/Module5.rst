Module 5: Display, share and archive
====================================

The module is part of the :ref:`ROSACE project <MainPage>`

At the end of the observing process, we must share our results and close the observation. 

This module will do it, with some important steps:

1. Validate the data by the observer (we never know, something may have happened).
2. Send the data to the relevant repository. Depending on the science case, it can be a database, as simple mail, or any other way.
3. Archive the data (raw data and result), and fullfill the local database, to make any future search fast and easy.

In a first time, we can make it manually, but as soon as the production increases, it must become automatic.
